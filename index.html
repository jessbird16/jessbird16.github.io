                        <h2>"A Little Life" by Hanya Yanagihara</h2>
                        <h3>Rating: 5*</h3>

                        <p>A Little Life is truly the best book I have ever read, and yet I don’t think I could ever read it again. It is one of those books that is so deeply impactful and gut-wrenching that to even get through the book is a feat in itself. I recall getting to a point in the book where I just had to take a step back and leave it for a while because I was crying so hard. in fact, I cried myself to sleep for a solid two weeks even after I’d finished the book.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "You're Jude St. Francis. You are my oldest, dearest friend" - <cite>Willem, A Little Life</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Hanya Yanagihara has explained how she wanted “everything turned up a little too high”; she wanted the violence and abuse to be too much, to exaggerate the pity, the empathy, the horror. I feel this is where some of the negative opinions stem from, because this book really does push the reader to their limits and perhaps even surpasses them, and the emotional impact it has is truly devastating. </p>
                        <p>She has likened A Little Life to an “ombré cloth”, in the sense that it begins as a lighter, bluish-white, and slowly progresses into something so dark it’s nearly black at the end. I feel this also adds to the impact of the book, as it just progressively gets darker in the second half, so much so that when you think it can’t possibly get any worse, it does. </p>
                        <p>Those who have not read A Little Life and are considering it, I do urge caution. Though I do not regret reading it for even a second, it is not a book that will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. </p>

                        <p>You might be sensing a theme in that I’m a fan of depressing books. I just love a book that makes me feel something but which does it in an insightful and thoughtful way, where it has an emotional impact whilst also offering perspective. </p>
                        <blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This entire book I just wanted to give Charlie a hug, but I also wanted to sit and pick his brain on anything and everything. I really do love books where the narrator has an interesting line of thought and I truly felt that in this book. The storyline with the aunt was shocking, in a literal sense, but the way it unfolded in the narration was just perfect. </p>
                        <p>The cover is also one of my all-time, absolute favourites. </p>

                        <h2>"Binding 13" Series by Chloe Walsh</h2>

                        <p>I absolutely adore this series because it combines two of my favourite things: cutesie romances and hard, heavy-hitting subjects.</p>
                        <p>Shannon & Johnny are just to die for, they are SO CUTE. I loved his protectiveness and how it literally panicked him because he liked her so much. Certain parts did feel slightly cringy, but I put that down to the nature of their relationship where they are young teenagers, so it’s going to feel that way at times. I also absolutely adored Johnny and Gibsie’s friendship (and the whole time, I just couldn’t wait for Gibsie’s book).</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "I love you, Shannon like the River" - <cite>Johnny, Binding 13</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Aoife’s & Joey’s were without a doubt my favourite books of the series. Joey’s story was absolutely devastating and I’d never really read a book that focused on this topic, so to read it from both his perspective and Aoife’s hit hard. I do think one particular aspect of Joey’s experience was overlooked slightly and perhaps could have been explored more (I don’t want to give spoilers), but I understand it was not the primary focus of his story. </p>
